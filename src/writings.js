Sway on a gray cradle
Rocked by the ocean’s arms.

Coral rocks sway soft
Clownfish dance in cradle's arms
Waves hum lullabies.

Below, shadows drift
A ballet of light and dark
Secrets of the deep.

Corals, they bloom
Growing under ocean’s care
Painting hidden worlds.

Eternal rhythm,
Ocean cradles ancient dreams
Time flows, and it sleeps.`

    excerpt: "three objects.",
    year: 2024,
    content: `In the corner of the abandoned study sat three things.
A black porcelain vase, chipped and cold.
A glass ink bottle, its contents thick as dried blood.
And a copy of the book, its cover cracked, its pages stained with age.
By day, the room was silent.
The vase reflected nothing.
The ink bottle clung to its shadows.
The book waited.
At night, when the house sank into silence, the whispers began.
The vase spoke first.
“Another failure,” it said, voice hollow. “The boy fears us.”
The ink bottle trembled, its black surface trembling like a ripple in dark water.
“Fear feeds him. Fear feeds me.”
The book laughed—a dry, brittle sound like paper tearing.
“Fear is the first offering. Knowledge is the second. Both will be taken.”
One night, the boy returned.
His hands shook as they brushed the book’s rough cover.
The room tightened around him, air sharp as a blade.
The black vase filled with a black light.
The ink bottle pulsed, full again, thick and alive.
The book opened itself, pages fluttering to a chapter on the decay of balance.
He wrote until his fingers cramped and bled.
The ink never ran out.
The shadows never blinked.
By dawn, the desk was wet with spilled ink—or something darker.
The boy’s head lay on the cold wood, lips parted in a silent prayer.
The vase stood still.
The ink bottle was empty.
And the book pulsed faintly, like a living heart, waiting for the next night.`

    content: `A:
It’s heavier when you don’t look at it.

B:
Don’t talk like that. Talk straight.

C:
Straight is gone. Curved took over years ago.

A:
I carried the shovel. I get first sentence.

B:
You always want first sentence. You never finish the thought.

C:
Nobody finishes. We just pause longer now.

A:
Say you don’t want it.

B:
I want it to stop changing the room.

C:
Too late.

A:
You hear that ringing?

B:
That’s your blood.

C:
That’s agreement trying to form.

A:
I could walk.

B:
You won’t.

C:
If you walk, it follows you in pieces.

A:
You both talk like witnesses.

B:
You talk like a defense.

C:
I talk like a delay.

A:
Count it with me.

B:
No.

C:
Yes. Quietly.

A:
One.

B:
Don’t touch it when you count.

C:
He already did. With his voice.

A:
Two.

B:
This is how you make decisions. By pretending numbers absolve you.

C:
Three is where it gets personal.

A:
I’m not asking.

B:
You never were.

C:
Ask anyway. I want to hear you fail at it.

A:
…Can I-

B:
No.

C:
See? Clean. Almost kind.

A:
Then why does it feel like permission.

B:
Because you mistake resistance for attention.

C:
And attention for love.

A:
I’m opening it.

B:
Of course you are.

C:
Hold on. Let it breathe first.

A:
It doesn’t need air.

B:
Neither did we. Look how that turned out.

C:
Open it. Or don’t. Either way, something’s coming out.

A:
If it ruins us—

B:
It won’t ruin us.

C:
It’ll clarify.

A:
I hate that word.

B:
You hate mirrors too.

C:
Go on.

A:
…

B:
Well?

C:
Say it slow.

A:
It’s empty.

B:
No it isn’t.

C:
No. That’s just all it needed to be.

A:
Then why are you both still staring.

B:
Because now we have to decide what we brought with us.

C:
And who gets to keep it.`

You’re in someplace dark.
In some moving vehicle. Going 5 miles per hour.

Away from the city. Away from hope.

What do you remember?

calm.

Streets. Yes streets. In broad daylight at the market. At Rue Muffetard.
Cabbage. Two pounds of cabbage, but–

Calm.

The stall across the way. Someone asked for pears.
No face? Yes, only the sleeve. Gray. Pressed.

Keep calm.

There was no door. But a creak.
There was cloth tearing. No cloth.

In the faintest ringing–

Calm.

The world closed. Too suddenly.

Just keep calm.

You look down.
The cabbage seems heavier than it should have been.
More.
But it seems like you carried it far more.`

His boots dangled like ornaments, bits of pink insulation floating down like cherry blossoms in spring.

From below, it looked like he had simply stepped into another world and paused halfway to admire the view.

“Hey, uh… you good up there?” someone called.

Silence. Then a laugh.

Nobody ever saw his face.

They didn’t need to.

Every day he’d be there: legs swinging gently, tapping out soft rhythms against the drywall, as though keeping time to a melody only he could hear.

“It’s brighter here. You should come up sometime.”

The foreman stopped asking questions.

The crew stopped patching the hole.

They learned to work around the legs, as if having a doorway to somewhere else was the most ordinary thing in the world.

And then one day, the legs were gone.

No insulation, no hole, not even a scuff on the plaster.

Just the faint hum of something waiting, somewhere above the ceiling, for anyone brave enough to take the next step.`

But when you’re broke, fresh out of college, and barely scraping rent, even a night shift security gig at an abandoned hospital starts to sound like a blessing.

“Just walk the halls twice a night,” the supervisor said, handing me a jangling set of keys. “Don't go near the west wing. It’s under renovation. You’ll set off the alarms.”

He didn’t smile. Not even a little. And he didn’t make eye contact when he said it.

The first night, everything was still. Too still.

No lights on except the flickering ones in the lobby. The elevator didn’t work. My footsteps echoed so loud they sounded like someone else was walking with me.

 I kept hearing the hum of machines that shouldn’t be running.
 
In the silence, my mind started to wander.

Why not the west wing?

What’s behind that sealed door on the third floor? Room 413?

The second night, I heard the whispering.
It started faint, like radio static.
Then I made out words.
“He's here.”
“Don’t let him open it.”
I froze in the stairwell.
They don’t know I can hear them.
That thought dug into me like a splinter.
I walked faster—heart thumping, hands clammy, flashlight trembling.
By the time I reached the third floor, the whispers had vanished. But as I passed Room 413, I noticed something new.
The door was cracked open.
The silver knob was gleaming.
I didn’t touch it. I swear. I didn’t do anything. I was not a stupid, careless boy in a horror story.
But inside the crack, something moved.
A pale face. Sunken eyes. A mouth twisted in silent panic.
I stumbled back.
When I looked again, the door was closed.
I reported it on the spot.
The supervisor said, “You’re tired. That room’s sealed. It’s been empty since 1998. We keep it locked because—”
He stopped.
I waited for him to finish.
He did not.
The room seemed chillier than before. I wanted to press him, but my common sense told me I shouldn’t do that to my boss.
So I left.
The hallway outside the office was emptier than before, the dim overhead light flickering. That’s when I saw it—a dusty old bulletin board near the lobby, covered in brittle, yellowed notices.
On it, a flyer.
A missing person flyer.
It had the same twisted mouth and hollowed eyes that stared back at me. The same ones that I saw in room 413.
The date read: 1988.

On the third night, I saw the cameras.
They weren’t security cameras.
They were old hospital monitors, grainy and gray, showing me the third floor in real time.
Room 413 was open. Wide.
And someone was inside, pacing, dragging one leg behind. Staring at the door like they were waiting for me.
He turned to the camera.
He waved.

Tonight is night four.
I got a voicemail from my manager.
"GET OUT BEF—SSHHHHH—TIME’S AL—ZZZKKT—"
I called out. 
But my boss won’t answer anymore. The hospital line is disconnected.
And the whispering is getting louder.

	I keep telling myself that I won’t open the door.
	But as I’m writing this very sentence, my hand is already turning the gleaming silver knob.

	A dusty letter sat on an old, shabby desk in the office across the hall.
	Room 413.
	Psychiatric Isolation Order.
	Do Not Open Under Any Circumstances.`
