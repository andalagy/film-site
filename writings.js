Sway on a gray cradle

Rocked by the ocean’s arms.


Coral rocks sway soft

Clownfish dance in cradle's arms

Waves hum lullabies.


Below, shadows drift

A ballet of light and dark

Secrets of the deep.


Corals, they bloom

Growing under ocean’s care

Painting hidden worlds.


Eternal rhythm,

Ocean cradles ancient dreams

Time flows, and it sleeps.

    excerpt: 'three objects.',
    content: `In the corner of the abandoned study sat three things.
	
A black porcelain vase, chipped and cold.

A glass ink bottle, its contents thick as dried blood.

And a copy of the book, its cover cracked, its pages stained with age.

By day, the room was silent.

The vase reflected nothing.

The ink bottle clung to its shadows.

The book waited.

At night, when the house sank into silence, the whispers began.

The vase spoke first.

	“Another failure,” it said, voice hollow. “The boy fears us.”
	
The ink bottle trembled, its black surface trembling like a ripple in dark water.

	“Fear feeds him. Fear feeds me.”
	
The book laughed—a dry, brittle sound like paper tearing.

	“Fear is the first offering. Knowledge is the second. Both will be taken.”
	
One night, the boy returned.

His hands shook as they brushed the book’s rough cover.

The room tightened around him, air sharp as a blade.

The black vase filled with a black light.

The ink bottle pulsed, full again, thick and alive.

The book opened itself, pages fluttering to a chapter on the decay of balance.

He wrote until his fingers cramped and bled.

The ink never ran out.

The shadows never blinked.

By dawn, the desk was wet with spilled ink—or something darker.

The boy’s head lay on the cold wood, lips parted in a silent prayer.

The vase stood still.

The ink bottle was empty.

And the book pulsed faintly, like a living heart, waiting for the next night.`

    excerpt: 'a simple conversation between three people.',
    content: `A:
It’s heavier when you don’t look at it.

B:
Don’t talk like that. Talk straight.

C:
Straight is gone. Curved took over years ago.

A:
I carried the shovel. I get first sentence.

B:
You always want first sentence. You never finish the thought.

C:
Nobody finishes. We just pause longer now.

A:
Say you don’t want it.

B:
I want it to stop changing the room.

C:
Too late. 

A:
You hear that ringing?

B:
That’s your blood.

C:
That’s agreement trying to form.

A:
I could walk.

B:
You won’t.

C:
If you walk, it follows you in pieces.

A:
You both talk like witnesses.

B:
You talk like a defense.

C:
I talk like a delay.

A:
Count it with me.

B:
No.

C:
Yes. Quietly.

A:
One.

B:
Don’t touch it when you count.

C:
He already did. With his voice.

A:
Two.

B:
This is how you make decisions. By pretending numbers absolve you.

C:
Three is where it gets personal.

A:
I’m not asking.

B:
You never were.

C:
Ask anyway. I want to hear you fail at it.

A:
…Can I-

B:
No.

C:
See? Clean. Almost kind.

A:
Then why does it feel like permission.

B:
Because you mistake resistance for attention.

C:
And attention for love.

A:
I’m opening it.

B:
Of course you are.

C:
Hold on. Let it breathe first.

A:
It doesn’t need air.

B:
Neither did we. Look how that turned out.

C:
Open it. Or don’t. Either way, something’s coming out.

A:
If it ruins us—

B:
It won’t ruin us.

C:
It’ll clarify.

A:
I hate that word.

B:
You hate mirrors too.

C:
Go on.

A:
…

B:
Well?

C:
Say it slow.

A:
It’s empty.

B:
No it isn’t.

C:
No. That’s just all it needed to be.

A:
Then why are you both still staring.

B:
Because now we have to decide what we brought with us.

C:
And who gets to keep it.`

    content: `So where are you?

You’re in someplace dark.
In some moving vehicle. Going 5 miles per hour. 

Away from the city. Away from hope.

What do you remember?

calm. 

Streets. Yes streets. In broad daylight at the market. At Rue Muffetard. 
Cabbage. Two pounds of cabbage, but– 

Calm. 

The stall across the way. Someone asked for pears. 
No face? Yes, only the sleeve. Gray. Pressed.

Keep calm.

There was no door. But a creak.
There was cloth tearing. No cloth. 

In the faintest ringing–

Calm.

The world closed. Too suddenly.

Just keep calm.

You look down.
The cabbage seems heavier than it should have been.
More.
But it seems like you carried it far more.`
